    raise ValueError(error_msg_for_incompatible_window_length)
ValueError: The `window_length` and the forecasting horizon are incompatible with the length of `y`. Found `window_length`=5092, `max(fh)`=12, but len(y)=5092. It is required that the window length plus maximum forecast horizon is smaller than the length of the time series `y` itself.
